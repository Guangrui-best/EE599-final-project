## Step 1: Autocomplete the location name
### Function:
```c++
std::vector<std::string> Autocomplete(std::string name);
```
- Transfrom the input name to the lower case. Then traverse all nodes in the given data. Each time we transform the data.name to the lower case and find the transformed name that contains the given prefix name. We push back these names to the result, which is our final output.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the given map.

## Step 2: Find the place's Coordinates in the Map
### Functions:
```c++
std::pair<double, double> GetPosition(std::string name);
```
- Traverse all nodes in the given data until we find the input name. If we find the name, record its latitude and longitude using GetLat() and GetLon(). Else we ouput (-1, -1).
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the give map.
```c++
double GetLat(std::string id);
```
- Given location's id, return its latitude.
- Time Complexity: O(1)
```c++
double GetLon(std::string id);
```
- Given location's id, return its longitude
- Time Complexity: O(1)

## Step 3: CalculateShortestPath between two places
### Functions:
```c++
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Dijkstra(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
```
- Each time add the nearest unvisited location into the set IsVisited. Update shortest distance of this locationâ€™s neighbors and its predecessor map. End until the location is the destination. Traverse the predecessor map and output the shortest path. If we traverse neighbors that we can obtain and do not meet the destination, that means the start node cannot arrive at the destination. In this case, we return empty path.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the given map.
```c++
std::vector<std::string> CalculateShortestPath_Bellman_Ford(std::string &location1_name,
                                               std::string &location2_name);
```
- Each time update the shortest distance and predecessor map by adding the intermediate edge by one. End until we traverse all nodes. If the destination has been updated, we traverse the predecessor map and output the shortest path. Else, it means the start point cannot arrive at the destination, we return empty path.
- Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges in the given map.
```c++
std::vector<std::string> GetNeighborIDs(std::string id);
```
- Given the location's name, return its neighbors.
- Time Complexity: O(1)

### The Travelling Trojan Problem (AKA Traveling Salesman!)
## Functions
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravellingTrojan(
      std::vector<std::string> &location_ids);
```
- Create an adjacent matrix with row and columns be locations reindexed id. Perform DFS to try all permutations of the path and find the minimum cost. Return the minimum cost and the corresponding path.
- Time Complexity: O(n!), where n is the number of nodes in the input
```c++
double TSP_helper(std::vector<std::vector<double>> &adjMatrix, std::vector<std::vector<int>> &results_idx,
      std::vector<int> &location_idx, int start, int curr, double &min_cost, 
      double curr_cost, std::vector<int> path);
```
- DFS algorithm. Find the minimum cost given the start.
- Time Complexity: O(n!), where n is the number of locations.
```c++
std::pair<double, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>> TravellingTrojan_2opt(
                                    std::vector<std::string> &location_ids);
```
